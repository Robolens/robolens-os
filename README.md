# RobolensOS 

In recent years, there always has been some arguments about how _wearable_ tech may violate our digital freedoms or privacy. In past 3 years, due to the progress of technology, movies including wearable tech (such as _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ or any other Marvel movie.) and also COVID-19 pandemic, wearable technology became more and more important to the humankind.

In early 2021, [Apple](http://apple.com/watch) introduced the new version of Apple Watch, which had some cool stuff for the current pandemic situation. For example, a SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) sensor or a feature which helps you wash your hands long enough to get rid of all the contamination you might have received from a public place.

In a short time, most of wearable gadgets included these features and people tried to have one of them at least. I was no exception. I got myself a _Xiaomi Mi Band 5_ in February 2021. It was one of the coolest gadgets I've ever had. But it still has problems I said above. I can't see what it does with my data. 

After watching Avengers, Spider-Man and some other Sci-Fi movies, I decided to make my own _Augmented Reality_ glasses, but with one big difference. I wanted it to be completely open source. This is why I started investigation and found my suitable hardware parts, and currently work on this simple OS for the project.
